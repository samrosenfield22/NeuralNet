IN PROGRESS

This is a neural net I'm writing for fun. It uses a genetic algorithm to evolve the weights of the neural network. While the goal of this program is currently to recognize pictures of digits, the real purpose is to develop and experiment, with the end goal of having reusable ANN/GA code.

All code is written by Sam Rosenfield.
